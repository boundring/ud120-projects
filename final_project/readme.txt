Project: Investigate Fraud in Enron Emails

readme.txt

Python version used:
  Python 3.8.5

---

Environment setup:

Please make use of python-3.8.yaml in the 'environments' directory to set
  up an environment compatible with all code used.

---

Explanation for use of Python 3.8.5:

In attempting to complete the coursework leading up to this project, I first
  tried using Python 2.7 and the package specification listed in the
  'requirements.txt' present in the github repo provided by Udacity.
The following section describes the problems I ran into then, and my course
  of action afterward. I wrote all this as documentation in order to share
  it with other WGU students, in the hopes it would save them any headaches.

---

First, project instructions direct students to use Python 2.7 and to make use
  of a git repo for miniprojects/course project code:
  https://github.com/udacity/ud120-projects.git

Unfortunately, there are some issues with that repo's package requirements.
  Contents of requirements.txt:
    "nltk==3.2.1
     numpy==1.11.2
     scikit-learn==0.18
     scipy==0.18.1:"

Given these required packages, attempting to set up an Anaconda environment
  will result in conflicts: two cannot be installed for a Python 2.7
  environment, and the other two are unavailable via Anaconda repositories for
  a windows 64-bit OS. Attempting to install these via 'pip' results in
  somewhat complicated dependency issues (long, long error messages) which
  seem to also be related to Python 2.7 deprecation. Otherwise, my assumption
  is that these conflicts are based in my using Windows 10.

I'm sure that setting up a Python 2.7 Anaconda environment with these packages
  used to be trivial. but the best I could manage due to dependencies for other
  packages and conflicts was:
    nltk          3.2.1
    numpy         1.16.6
    scikit-learn  0.20.3
    scipy         1.2.1

For reference, here's the total output of 'conda list' for that environment,
  which includes all packages installed as dependencies for those listed just
  now:

This setup permitted completion of some small portion of the course's material,
  but by the time I got along to a portion which made generation of plot
  windows via matplotlib necessary, popup-window generation via 'qt' failed,
  and my patience ran out.

Maybe those matplotlib.pyplot.show() call errors were related to the versions
  of pyqt or qt and how they interacted with the IDEs I tried (Sublime, VScode,
  and I'll beg you to believe that I set up their environment usage correctly
  and have used either for many, many projects), maybe the version for sip,
  maybe any number of combinations of dependencies interacting via functools32
  backport from Python 3.2 to 2.7, since functools32 was deemed	necessary by
  the environment dependency solver.

I'm sure much of the final project for the course can be completed with a
  Python 2.7 base, and that any number of workarounds may exist for the kinds
  of errors I encountered. Troubleshooting package dependency issues does not
  appeal to me, though, and that kind of effort is necessarily outside the
  scope of the course's material.

After exploring Udacity's "Knowledge" Q&As, I came across one contracted
  mentor/project reviewer repeatedly answering questions about Python 2.7
  issues with his own issue and personal solution: since macOS Big Sur does not
  support Python 2.7 at all, anymore, he's made his own *unofficial* update to
  the project's codebase in order to grade students' work:
    https://medium.com/udacity-course-companion/detecting-enron-fraud-in-macos-big-sur-edd2309f7389
    https://github.com/oforero/ud120-projects/tree/python-3.8

This seemed like a good starting point for attempting to complete the
  coursework and project with a newer version of Python, as contributors to
  that repo have been updating the code to reflect changes in the libraries
  involved, mitigating a wide variety of issues cited in Udacity "Knowledge"
  questions. Let it be known that no changes involving completion of any
  student-assigned code work have been made, to my knowledge or otherwise.

Of course, there were still some issues with the packages used in that project,
  as well. He suggests creating a Python 3.8 Anaconda environment by way of
  'python-3.8.yaml', a specification file which can be used in this manner:
    'conda env create environments/python-3.8.yaml'

Unfortunately, that syntax fails for my OS, and I had to use:
  'conda env create f=python-3.8.yaml'
(directly from 'environments' directory of the cloned repo, in this case)

At that point, environment creation failed due to these packages not being
  available for windows 64-bit systems via Anaconda repositories:
    libcxx=10.0.0
    libedit=3.1.20191231
    libffi=3.3
    libgfortran=3.0.1
    llvm-openmp=10.0.0
    ncurses=6.2
    readline=8.0

Makes sense, given what some of those are. Removing those lines from
  python-3.8.yaml, a wide variety of package conflicts resulted, but those were
  mitigated by further removal of these lines:
    mkl=2019.4
    pip=20.3.3
    wheel=0.36.2

After those changes, the environment was created successfully. Testing a
	miniproject script that relies on generating matplotlib.pyplot.show() windows
	resulted in success, visible plots.

For reference, here's the total output of 'conda list' for that environment:

Let it be known that nltk is not specified in python-3.8.yaml, and that it
  and these dependencies were installed separately:
    nltk    3.5
    click   7.1.2
    regex   2020.11.13
    tqdm    4.56.0

nltk is used in coursework, but is not mandatory for the final project.
